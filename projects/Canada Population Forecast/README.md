## Canadian Population Projection & Analysis (2024-2033)

### 📌 Overview

This project analyzes and forecasts Canada's population trends for the next 10 years (2024-2033) using historical data from Statistics Canada (2014-2023). The goal is to provide data-driven insights to support policymakers, urban planners, and government officials in making informed decisions on infrastructure development, healthcare planning, and workforce policies.

### 📊 Key Features

✅ Population Projection: Uses forecasting models to estimate Canada’s population growth by age group, gender, and province<br>
✅ Demographic Analysis: Examines aging population, youth migration, and urbanization trends<br>
✅ Tableau Dashboard: Interactive visualizations for data-driven decision-making<br>
✅ Forecasting Techniques: Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, Cohort Component Model<br>
✅ Policy Recommendations: Insights for healthcare, labor markets, and infrastructure planning

### 📊 Data Sources & Preprocessing

Source: Statistics Canada (2014-2023 historical data)<br>
<br>
Cleaning & Processing:<br>

Handled missing values with linear interpolation<br>
Standardized column names & data types<br>
Filtered anomalies and ensured consistency<br>
Pivoted and unpivoted raw data for better structuring<br>
Created age buckets for population cohorts

### 📈 Forecasting Techniques Used

Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters Method) → Captures short-term growth trends <br>
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) → Projects long-term shifts<br>
Cohort Component Model (CCM) → Incorporates birth rates, death rates & migration trends<br>

### 📊 Visualizations & Insights (Tableau Dashboard)

🟩 Heatmap: Population Age Distribution by Province → Identifies regions with rapid aging<br>
📉 Line Chart: Population Growth Trends → Highlights fast-growing provinces<br>
📊 Bar Chart: Migration Trends by Province → Shows migration patterns<br>

### 📌 Key Insights & Policy Recommendations

🔹 Aging Population → Increased demand for healthcare & senior housing particularly in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, and BC<br>
🔹 Youth Migration → Some provinces face net youth out-migration particularly from the maritime and prairie provinces<br>
🔹 Urban Growth → Expansion needed in public transit, housing, & schools for Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, and BC<br>
🔹 Workforce Trends → Growth in working-age population requires policy adjustments

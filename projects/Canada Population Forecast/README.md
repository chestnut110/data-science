## Canadian Population Projection & Analysis (2024-2033)

### ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project analyzes and forecasts Canada's population trends for the next 10 years (2024-2033) using historical data from Statistics Canada (2014-2023). The goal is to provide data-driven insights to support policymakers, urban planners, and government officials in making informed decisions on infrastructure development, healthcare planning, and workforce policies.

### ðŸ“Š Key Features

âœ… Population Projection: Uses forecasting models to estimate Canadaâ€™s population growth by age group, gender, and province<br>
âœ… Demographic Analysis: Examines aging population, youth migration, and urbanization trends<br>
âœ… Tableau Dashboard: Interactive visualizations for data-driven decision-making<br>
âœ… Forecasting Techniques: Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, Cohort Component Model<br>
âœ… Policy Recommendations: Insights for healthcare, labor markets, and infrastructure planning
